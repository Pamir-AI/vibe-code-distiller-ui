## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi with Node.js 18+ installed
- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line

### Installation

1. **Clone and install**:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd claude-code-web-manager
npm install
```

2. **Setup dependencies**:
```bash
# Install tmux and download TTYd binary
chmod +x setup-dependencies.sh
./setup-dependencies.sh
```

3. **Start the application**:
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Access from any device**:
Open your browser and go to `http://your-pi-ip:8080`

That's it! You can now manage your Claude Code projects from any device on your network.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `config/default.json`. Here are the key settings you might want to adjust:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 8080,
    "host": "0.0.0.0"
  },
  "claude": {
    "executable": "claude",
    "maxSessions": 5
  },
  "terminal": {
    "tmux": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sessionPrefix": "claude-web"
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Terminal Architecture
- **TTYd Integration**: Uses TTYd service for native terminal experience
- **iframe Embedding**: Terminal embedded seamlessly via iframe
- **WebSocket Separation**: Isolated WebSocket handling for stability
- **Proxy Configuration**: HTTP proxy routes `/terminal` to TTYd service

### Terminal Sessions
- Each project gets its own terminal session
- Sessions persist even when you close your browser (thanks to tmux)
- You can reconnect from any device and continue where you left off
- Native terminal experience with full keyboard support

### Project Management
- Browse your projects in the sidebar navigation
- Click the "New Project" button to create new projects (automatically saved in ~/projects)
- Click the "+" button next to any project to create a new terminal session for that project
- Upload files directly to specific projects using drag-and-drop
- Download entire projects as compressed archives to your local device

## Features Explained

### TTYd Terminal Integration
Modern terminal interface with native experience:
- **Native Performance**: Full-featured terminal without frontend overhead
- **Stable Connections**: Eliminated complex WebSocket management
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard support including special keys
- **Copy/Paste**: Native copy/paste functionality

### Tmux Integration
When enabled, your terminal sessions become persistent:
- Start coding on your laptop
- Switch to your phone/tablet and continue
- Sessions survive browser crashes and network disconnections
- Sessions are automatically managed for you

### File Management
- **Drag-and-drop upload**: Drop files directly into the interface
- **Download functionality**: Download individual files or entire project archives
- **File operations**: Create, delete, rename files and folders
- **File preview modal**: Preview files with enhanced error handling
- **Double-click integration**: Send file path to terminal for easy Claude Code queries
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code files display with proper syntax highlighting

### Image Management
- **Dedicated image interface**: Separate image management system
- **Image preview**: View images directly in the browser
- **Image upload**: Drag-and-drop image files
- **Format support**: Common image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.)
- **Integrated workflow**: Seamless integration with file management

### System Monitoring
Keep track of your Raspberry Pi's health with real-time monitoring:
- **CPU usage**: Real-time CPU utilization percentage
- **Temperature monitoring**: System temperature for thermal management
- **Memory usage**: RAM utilization and available memory
- **Live updates**: Automatic refresh of system statistics
- **Status indicators**: Visual indicators in the header
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor system performance during development

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 8080 is busy**:
```bash
# Kill whatever is using port 8080
sudo lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
# Or change the port in config/default.json
```

**Can't find Claude CLI**:
- Make sure `claude` command works in your terminal
- Update the path in `config/default.json` if needed

**Can't find TTYd**:
- Ensure TTYd binary exists: `ls -la ttyd.aarch64`
- Re-run setup script: `./setup-dependencies.sh`
- Verify TTYd binary is executable: `chmod +x ttyd.aarch64`

**Terminal not loading**:
- Check if TTYd is running: `ps aux | grep ttyd`
- Verify port 7681 is accessible: `netstat -tlnp | grep 7681`

**Can't connect from other devices**:
- Make sure your Pi's firewall allows port 8080
- Check that you're using the correct IP address

### Logs
Check the logs if something goes wrong:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log        # General logs
tail -f logs/error.log      # Error logs only
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using PM2 (Optional)
If you want the app to start automatically and stay running:

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start the app with PM2
npm run pm2:start

# Make it start on boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Custom Shell Commands
Add your own shortcuts by modifying the terminal service or creating custom scripts in your project directories.

## Development

### File Structure
- `server/app.js` - Main Express application with TTYd proxy
- `server/services/` - Core business logic
- `server/routes/` - API endpoints
- `public/assets/js/terminal-ttyd.js` - TTYd frontend integration
- `public/assets/css/` - Styling

### Adding Features
1. Backend: Add new routes in `server/routes/`
2. Frontend: Add new JavaScript modules in `public/assets/js/`
3. Styling: Update CSS in `public/assets/css/`

### Testing
Use Playwright to test the interface in a real browser:
```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install -D playwright

# Run tests (create your own test files)
npx playwright test
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Performance on Raspberry Pi
- The app is optimized for Pi's limited resources
- TTYd provides native terminal performance
- Close unused terminal sessions to save memory
- Use tmux to keep sessions alive without browser overhead

### Multi-Device Usage
- Bookmark `http://your-pi-ip:8080` on all your devices
- Use the same session across devices for seamless coding
- The interface adapts to phone/tablet screen sizes

### Security Note
This app is designed for personal use on your local network. It doesn't have authentication enabled by default since it's meant to be used only by you on your own Pi.
