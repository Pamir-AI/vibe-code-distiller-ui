# Bug Fix Plan: Missing Frontend Files

## Issue Identified

### Critical Issue: Missing Public Directory
- **Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/distiller/claudeCodeUi/public/index.html'`
- **Impact**: Cannot access the web interface - 404 errors when visiting the application
- **Root Cause**: The entire `public` directory with frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) is missing from the repository

## Current Situation

The server is running correctly on port 3000 and can be accessed from other devices on the network, but returns 404 errors because:
1. No `public` directory exists
2. No `index.html` file exists
3. No frontend assets (CSS, JavaScript, libraries) exist

## Temporary Solution

For now, to access from another laptop on the same network:
1. The server IP is: 192.168.0.48
2. Would normally access at: http://192.168.0.48:3000
3. But this returns 404 due to missing files

## Fix Options

### Option 1: Restore Missing Files
- Check if files were accidentally gitignored
- Look for a separate frontend repository
- Check commit history for deleted files

### Option 2: Create Minimal Frontend
- Create basic HTML interface
- Add xterm.js for terminal
- Add Socket.IO client
- Create project management UI

### Option 3: Use API Directly
- The API endpoints are functional at:
  - http://192.168.0.48:3000/api/status
  - http://192.168.0.48:3000/api/projects
  - etc.

## Recommended Action

Create a minimal working frontend to restore functionality. The backend is fully operational, just needs the UI files.
